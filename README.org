* api-hi

A lib to api-fy things (ORMs) using some other things (web frameworks)

In the end it should not be tied to one specific ORM or framework.
It is not made for complicated APIs, only two 'levels' on the API:
/ and /<id>
If there is any relation to go through, we can iterate over their ID
and query the right API path

use a decorator from an authentication library (ie: bottle-cork)

to map the GET to the url '/map/to' and '/map/to/<id>'
#+BEGIN_SRC python
api_hi('/map/to', someModel, someWebApp, methods=['GET'], auth=authDecorator)
#+END_SRC
